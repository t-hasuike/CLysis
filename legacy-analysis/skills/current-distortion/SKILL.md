# /current-distortion -- Distortion Analysis Skill

## Overview

Systematically detect "distortions" (validation gaps, implicit dependencies, type comparison traps, race conditions, etc.) lurking in legacy code and organize findings from three perspectives (business process-driven, root cause-driven, and remediation-impact-driven). This skill produces structured, actionable reports with risk classification via a 2-axis framework: **5 Root Cause Axes (A-E)** and **6 Symptom Patterns (DR1-DR6)**.

**Design Philosophy**: "Detect risks" then "Organize from 3 perspectives" (output-centric 2-Phase design). Distortion investigation does not produce standalone artifacts; instead, risks are naturally embedded within the Part A/B/C output.

See `config/terminology.md` for term customization.

## Scope

### Target
- Real-world problems existing in codebase across multiple repositories
- Cross-repository problems spanning service boundaries (P7-P11)
- Structural and logical distortions affecting data integrity, control flow, and system boundaries
- Root causes spanning validation gaps (A), type/value mismatches (B), logic gaps (C), architectural flaws (D), and security issues (E)
- All 6 symptom patterns (DR1-DR6): data corruption, crashes, missing checks, inconsistencies, data loss, cross-system divergence

### Out of Scope
- Hypothetical/generic anti-patterns (comprehensive SOLID violations, etc.)
- Security vulnerability audits (handled by `/review-code`)
- Performance optimization (separate investigation)
- Problems requiring business specification changes (requires human decision first)
- Operational knowledge loss (addressed via documentation and knowledge management)

## Target

$ARGUMENTS

## Usage

### Command Syntax

```
/distortion-analysis [repository-name] [target-area]
/distortion-analysis Phase 1 [repository-name] [target-area]
/distortion-analysis Phase 2
```

### Examples

```
# Default (all-in-one: Phase 1 -> Phase 2 in sequence)
/distortion-analysis your-ec-repo checkout-flow
/distortion-analysis your-backend-repo order-delivery

# Step-by-step execution (explicit Phase)
/distortion-analysis Phase 1 your-backend-repo order-delivery
/distortion-analysis Phase 2

# Discussion integration
/distortion-analysis your-ec-repo checkout-flow --discussion 42
```

When Phase is omitted, it runs as all-in-one (All). Step-by-step execution requires explicit Phase specification.

---

## Execution Flow

```
Phase omitted (default): Phase 1 -> Leader integration -> Phase 2 (all-in-one)
Phase 1 only: Risk collection -> Leader verbally reports count & severity distribution to User
Phase 2 only: Takes Phase 1 integration results as input -> Creates Part A/B/C
```

## Phase 1: Risk Collection

### Purpose

Detect all risks that serve as material for Part A/B/C. Runs integration of existing investigation results and code distortion investigation (4 perspectives) in parallel.

### Worker Formation

Launch 6 workers in parallel.

| Worker | Agent Type | Assignment | Investigation Content | Pattern Coverage |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Worker A | investigator | Integrate existing investigation results | Extract and merge known risks from past reports in reports/; deduplicate; preserve source tracking | All patterns |
| Worker B | investigator | Flag consistency & soft-delete gaps | Implicit shared-flag dependencies, missing logical deletion filters, JOIN condition validation | P1, P4, P11 |
| Worker C | investigator | Cross-table consistency & conversions | Foreign key constraints, data transformation gaps, format/type divergence between tables | P2, P5, P11 |
| Worker D | investigator | Constant/Enum definition drift | Mismatch between code constant defs and DB values; hardcoded values; multi-repo divergence | P2, P3 |
| Worker E | investigator | Type comparison & branching gaps | Type coercion pitfalls, insufficient case handling, missing else/default branches, validation omissions | P3, P6 |
| Worker E2 | investigator | Concurrency, async, external deps | Idempotency gaps, unreplayable transitions, async state sync issues, external service SPoFs | P7, P8, P9, P10 |

### Detection Framework: Problem Patterns (P1-P11)

Each worker uses these 11 problem patterns as detection criteria:

| ID | Pattern Name | Description | Detection Focus |
|----|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| P1 | Implicit shared flag dependency | Multiple processes reference the same flag column/variable with different assumptions | Cross-search references to flag columns/variables. Record "whose/what" flag using Subject-First Rule |
| P2 | Constant/Enum mismatch | Code constant definitions diverge from DB stored values or differ across repositories | Compare Enum/const declarations with DB initial data and schema; cross-repo comparisons |
| P3 | Type comparison traps | Language-specific loose comparison pitfalls (PHP `==` vs `===`, missing strict flags in searches) | Loose equality operators, missing strict parameters, switch-case type coercion |
| P4 | Soft-delete/JOIN condition gaps | Missing logical deletion filters (e.g., soft-delete flags) or incomplete JOIN conditions | SQL queries, ORM scopes, raw queries; search for deleted-record filters |
| P5 | Implicit value conversion | Unintended type/value conversions during processing affect correctness | Casts, type conversion functions, date/time parsing, encoding/decoding |
| P6 | Insufficient branching | Missing cases, if-else without else, switch without default, unhandled exceptions | Branch coverage analysis, explicit error handling validation |
| P7 | Non-idempotent concurrent operations | Concurrent mutations on same resource lack idempotency; collisions cause data inconsistency | Database/file mutation without idempotency guarantees; concurrent request handling without locks |
| P8 | Unreplayable state transitions | Mid-way processing failure cannot safely retry due to irreversible side effects | External API calls followed by DB updates; SFTP sends before DB updates; message publishing before persistence |
| P9 | Async boundary gaps | Integrity between sync and async processing not guaranteed; state stuck in intermediate states | Sync request completes before async worker starts; flag updates delayed or not propagated |
| P10 | External dependency single points of failure | External service dependencies lack redundancy, timeouts, or recovery; messages can be lost | No retry limits, no fallback paths, message loss on service unavailability |
| P11 | Data context loss | Data loses intent/metadata as it transforms through integration points | Identity/reference loss when external process writes; session context not persisted; type/semantic divergence across boundaries |

### Classification Framework: 2-Axis Risk Model

Risk classification uses **two orthogonal axes**: Root Cause (A-E) and Symptom Pattern (DR1-DR6).

#### Root Cause Axes (A-E)

**Classification Priority**: E → D → C → B → A (evaluate in this order; highest-ranked root cause is primary)

| ID | Root Cause | Description | Scope |
|----|-----------|-------------|-------|
| E | Security & Robustness defects | Missing authentication, authorization, input validation; insufficient error handling | Authentication gaps, injection vulnerabilities, unhandled exceptions |
| D | Architecture & Design flaws | Structural issues: responsibility separation failures, circular dependencies, inappropriate layering, session-dependent designs | Design patterns, system boundaries, component coupling |
| C | Algorithmic/Logic gaps | Incomplete branching, missing cases, unhandled edge cases; conditions without corresponding handlers | if-else without else, switch without default, null checks, case coverage |
| B | Value/Type conversion defects | Type mismatches, implicit conversions, encoding/format divergence, constant-definition drift | Type coercion, casting, data representation mismatches |
| A | Validation bypass | Insufficient validation allowing invalid data to pass downstream | Input validation, state preconditions, boundary checks |

#### Symptom Patterns (DR1-DR6)

Describes **how the risk manifests** in the system:

| ID | Symptom | Description | Typical Manifestation |
|----|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| DR1 | Invalid data passes | Invalid/expired values flow to downstream processing without rejection | Expired items in cart, out-of-range values in computations |
| DR2 | Stops/crashes midway | Processing succeeds initially, then fails downstream or crashes unexpectedly | Order created but fulfillment dispatch errors; NullPointerException in payment |
| DR3 | Check missing entirely | Required validation step does not exist in code | No expiration check at all, missing authorization check |
| DR4 | Inconsistent behavior | Same operation produces different results in different contexts or systems | Pricing differs between frontend validation and backend logic |
| DR5 | Silent data loss | Data modified, lost, or corrupted without explicit error | Concurrent updates overwrite each other; async transitions skip states |
| DR6 | Cross-system divergence | Data representation or meaning differs across service boundaries or repositories | ProductType stored as int in one service, string in another |

### Subject-First Rule

When documenting risks, always explicitly state "whose/what" as the subject for flags, variables, and columns.

```
Bad: "When soft-delete flag is 0..."
Good: "When event table's soft-delete flag (event logical deletion flag) is 0..."

Bad: "publication_end_date is not checked"
Good: "Event's publication end date (event.publication_end_date) is not checked in PaymentProcessor.php's payment processing"
```

### Phase 1 Output

**No file output by default.** The leader receives all workers' results, performs deduplication and integration, and holds them locally. Passes directly to Phase 2.

**When Phase 1 only is executed**: The leader verbally reports the integration summary (count, severity distribution) to the user. Only output to an intermediate file if the user explicitly requests "save to file."

---

## Phase 2: Part A/B/C Creation

### Purpose

Organize all risks collected in Phase 1 from 3 perspectives and create final deliverables.

### Worker Formation

Launch 3 workers in parallel.

| Worker | Agent Type | Assignment | Output File |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Worker F | general-purpose | Part A: Business Process-driven | Part A section of `reports/distortion-report-[repo]-[area]-[date].md` |
| Worker G | general-purpose | Part B: Root Cause-driven | Part B section of same file |
| Worker H | general-purpose | Part C: Remediation Impact-driven + Visualization | Part C section of same file |

**Note**: The integrated report is a single file. In Phase 2, the leader integrates the 3 workers' outputs into 1 file. Each worker creates only their respective section; the leader performs integration.

### Part A: Business Process-driven

Map all risks to business processes (e.g., PR1-PR5 or your project's process definitions).

- Place risks at each process sub-step
- List distortion-discovered risks and existing investigation risks without distinction
- Include source breakdown (existing investigation: Y items + distortion survey: Z items) in the overview section

### Part B: Root Cause-driven

Classify all risks by problem pattern (P1-P11) and map to root cause axes (A-E) and symptom patterns (DR1-DR6).

**Part B Responsibility**: Describe state and severity (why it happens + how critical). Explain root cause chain (which axis is primary + which problem pattern). Delegate remediation specifics to Part C.

- Analyze root causes for each pattern (P1-P11)
- Map to root cause axes (A-E) using priority order: E → D → C → B → A
- Map to symptom patterns (DR1-DR6)
- Present remediation approach and effort estimate
- **Remediation Priority Table** (the core of Part B): List remediation targets, resolved risks, and ROI

### Part C: Remediation Impact-driven (WHAT TO DO)

Organize remediation priority, remediation class, side effects, and ordering constraints for all risks. Provide a decision-maker-oriented view.

**Remediation Class Classification**:

| Class | Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Quick Fix** | Single file, few lines, no side effects | Low difficulty + high severity |
| **Planned Fix** | Multiple files, no design change needed | Medium difficulty + high severity |
| **Architecture Fix** | Includes design changes, cross-cutting | High difficulty OR P7-P10 pattern |
| **Deferred** | Currently no business impact, high fix cost | High difficulty + low severity |

- Remediation priority matrix (ROI: difficulty vs resolved count)
- Remediation side-effect map (when Fix A impacts System B)
- Remediation ordering constraints (dependencies between fixes)

## Cross-Cutting Risk View

When distortion analysis covers multiple repositories, risks that span repository boundaries require special attention. The **Cross-Cutting Risk View** provides a two-layer management approach:

### L1: Component-Level View
- Risks within a single repository/component
- Managed within each distortion report

### L2: Cross-Cutting View
- Risks that span multiple repositories
- Shared flags referenced differently across repos
- Data flow integrity across service boundaries
- Inconsistent validation between frontend and backend

**When to create L2 view**: After completing L1 analyses for 2+ repositories in related areas, synthesize cross-cutting risks into a separate section or dedicated report.
